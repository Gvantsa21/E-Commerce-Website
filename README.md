This is a React-based shopping website my group built for our final project.
It includes all the main features of a basic online shopping app, users can browse products by category (Women, Men, Kids),
switch between different currencies ($, €, ¥) with the prices updating automatically, and view detailed product pages
with image previews and size selection. We also added a cart system that works across all pages.
There’s a full checkout flow with separate pages for shipping info, shipping method, payment (with basic validation), and order confirmation.
We managed all the state with React hooks like usestate, and use effect, and also local storage and we tried to keep the UI as close as
possible to the Figma design.
to run just open the terminal and npm start.
